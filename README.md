# NAI-attg-exploration -- warning: does not fully work yet.
 This code is to allow people with no coding experience to do research on the bracketed stuff at the start of a NovelAI story. (attg and more) 
 - It makes API calls, and then sorts the responses and puts the results into json files.
 
 NovelAI is a website where you can co-author stories with an Artifical Intelligence trained to write stories. Check it out at novelai.net
