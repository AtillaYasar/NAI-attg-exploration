# NAI-attg-exploration -- warning: does not fully work yet.

 ## What is this for?
 This code is to allow people with no coding experience to do research on the bracketed stuff at the start of a NovelAI story. (attg and more) 
 
 It makes API calls, processes the responses and puts them into json files, and one outputs.txt. Then goes through the responses, including the probabilities of alternative tokens (logprobs), and puts them together into one json, so you can gain insights from them.
