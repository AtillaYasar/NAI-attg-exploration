The format: $$$<version 1 name>:<text>,,,<version 2 name>:<text>$$$
- So 3 dollah dollah bills at the start and end, triple commas to separate versions, and a colon to separate a version's name from its text

- You can put these multiple times in the same prompt, if a version affects multiple different parts of the text
- The numbers don't affect anything, they are just for your own convenience, in case you have a lot of versions
- Put the coded prompt in 'coded prompt.txt', and the outputs will appear in 'coded outputs.txt'

Example:
$$$a:version a,,,69:version b$$$
[ Author: $$$a:some schmuck,,,69:Atilla$$$; Tags: adventure, urban fantasy ]
